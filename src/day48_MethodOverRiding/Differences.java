 method overloading:  same name, different parmeter
                    return type doesn't matter
                    access modifiers don't matter
                    any method can be overload  
                    
       
                    
method overriding: same name, same parameters, implementation functionality is different
                  Return-Type MUST be same
                    cannot happen in the smae class
                    method MUST be override in sub class
                    ONLY THE INSTANCE METHODS CAN BE OVERRIDE
                    constructor and static methods cannot be overriden
                    private methods cannot be override
                    the method we are going to override MUST be inheritable to the sub class
                    override method' access modifiers need to be same or more visible
                                default ==> deafult, protected, public
                                protected ==> protected, public
                                public ==> public
                                private ==> cannot be overridden
                            public > protected > default > private
